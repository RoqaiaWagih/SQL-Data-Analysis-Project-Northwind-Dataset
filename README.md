# **SQL Data Analysis Project: Northwind Dataset**

## **Overview**  
This project involves analyzing the Northwind dataset to uncover actionable business insights. The analysis focuses on key aspects of the business, such as sales performance, customer value, product trends, and supplier contributions. It demonstrates the use of SQL techniques to query, filter, aggregate, and join data efficiently, providing practical solutions to real-world business problems.

## **Project Objectives**  

1. **Sales Performance by Region**  
   Analyze total sales revenue and order counts for each region, identifying high-performing areas.  

2. **Identifying High-Value Customers**  
   Find customers who generate the highest revenue and frequently order from the store.  

3. **Top-Selling Products and Categories**  
   Evaluate the most successful products and categories in terms of sales and demand.  

4. **Order Fulfillment Analysis**  
   Examine order lead times and identify delays to improve customer satisfaction.  

5. **Supplier Contribution to Inventory**  
   Analyze supplier contributions and their impact on revenue and inventory.

## **Technologies Used**  

- **SQL**: Filtering, wildcards, aggregate functions, grouping, subqueries, joins, and ordering.  
- **Database**: Northwind dataset.  
- **Tools**: Any SQL client (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

---

## **SQL Techniques Demonstrated**  

1. **SELECT and FROM Statements**  
   Basic data extraction from multiple tables.  
2. **LIMIT Statement**  
   Restrict the number of records for analysis.  
3. **Filtering with WHERE and Wildcards**  
   Extract specific data using conditions and patterns.  
4. **Aggregate Functions (AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM)**  
   Perform calculations on grouped data.  
5. **GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses**  
   Segment data for summary analysis and apply conditions.  
6. **Subqueries**  
   Nest queries to refine analysis.  
7. **Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)**  
   Combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive insights.  
8. **ORDER BY**  
   Sort results for better readability and analysis.

## **Example Queries**  

### **1. Sales Performance by Region**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.Region AS Region, 
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders, 
    SUM(od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
WHERE c.Region IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.Region
HAVING TotalSales > 10000
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

### **2. Identifying High-Value Customers**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID, 
    c.CompanyName, 
    SUM(od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
WHERE c.CompanyName LIKE '%Inc%'
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName
HAVING SUM(od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice) > 5000
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

3. **Top-Selling Products**  
   Focus on stocking and promoting top-selling products and categories to meet customer demand efficiently.  

4. **Streamlined Order Fulfillment**  
   Address delays in order shipments by optimizing supply chain logistics and improving internal processes.  

5. **Supplier Strategies**  
   Negotiate better deals with suppliers who significantly contribute to revenue and inventory.
